Not there is much to say, but if you wish to learn here is something about me: 

### Bio

I'm from the country. Love nature and the out door scenery. Though a big technologist. Especially when it comes to microprocessor based systems and networking. Though with so many new and cool things coming out who knows where my interests might land next.
