Not that there is much to say, but if you wish to here are some things to learn about me: 

### Bio

I'm from the country. Love nature and the out door scenery. Though a big technologist. Especially when it comes to microprocessor based systems and networking. Though with so many new and cool things coming out who knows where my interests might land next or what I'm pursuing at any given time.
