I"ï<p>This guide will help to guide newbies through the concept of modding their Nintendo Switch or maybe even provide some refreshers for even a seasoned veteran hopefully. Though before we proceed we have to get this out of the way first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modding your Nintendo Switch enables you with the ability to do a lot of things. This can include a series of the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Game Backups</li>
    <li>Save Backups from Device NAND</li>
    <li>Homebrew Applications and Games</li>
    <li>Cheat Codes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However with this being said this does mean that your device can be what is considered â€˜bannedâ€™. Which means your unit wonâ€™t be able to connect to the Nintendo Store or be used to play online. If this is something you wish to avoid I highly recommend you advert from modding your device. If you are not concerned with these risks proceed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Apologies</em></strong> but that has to be covered before proceeding. If you donâ€™t understand the risks then again donâ€™t proceed. This is a simple teether non-persistent mod. However it can compromise the use of your Nintendo Switch so donâ€™t just arbitrarily do it. <strong><em>Despite all these warnings</em></strong> if that hasnâ€™t detoured you then letâ€™s get going.</p>
