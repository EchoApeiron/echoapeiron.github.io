I"©<p>As you may recall I indicated an issue in my article Jellyfin, Networking and SSL. This issue was grave to the extent that it didnâ€™t allow the web app to connect through the reverse proxy. The below link will allow you to re-read if needed, but ultimately it was an issue to how the SSL certificate was implemented.</p>

<p>Ultimately it ended up being a misconfiguration from my part and how my registrar provided the certificates. How did I find out that my SSL certificate was implemented improperly to begin with? Well I was informed that actually we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_client</code> feature of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl</code> to validate if a SSL connection is valid or not. So my goal here is to quickly explain how to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl</code> in order to validate the certificate. As well as how to look up your registrarâ€™s direction on installing their SSL certificates.</p>
