I"h<p>This guide will help to guide newbies through the concept of modding their Nintendo Switch or maybe even provide some refreshers for even a seasoned veteran hopefully. Though before we proceed we have to get this out of the way first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modding your Nintendo Switch enables you with the ability to do a lot of things. This can include a series of the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Game Backups</li>
    <li>Save Backups from Device NAND</li>
    <li>Homebrew Applications and Games</li>
    <li>Cheat Codes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However with this being sad this does mean that your device can be what is considered ‘banned’. Which means your unit won’t be able to connect to the Nintendo Store or be used to play online. If this is something you wish to avoid I highly recommend you advert from modding your device. If you are not concerned with these risks proceed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Apologies</em></strong> but that has to be covered before proceeding.</p>
